File Structure
--------------
Under `files/` a directory for each project is created. Please follow the instructions below.

1. Lowercase
2. No special characters or spaces. Allowed: . - _
3. Only the name of the project
4. If the project is a plugin of a library, append the name of the library. ex: `jquery.blurjs`, `bootstrap.select`

In some cases a few exceptions can be made.


A project's directory should contain the following:

1. `info.ini` containing all the necessary information. [Example][2]
2. Directories named after the version of each project. 
* The version directories can contain in their names numbers, letters and -,_ symbols.
3. Do not create a `latest` version directory unless you are the author and plan to maintain it as new versions come out.

A version directory should contain the following:

1. Static files needed for the project to work. 
2. A .zip file named after the project containing all of the current version directory files.
3. If there is no minified version of the main js/css file please create your own. [Tool][3] (Minify only, no symbol obfuscation. )
4. Do not upload useless files like demos, examples, licenses, readmes or any other file not being used in the production.
